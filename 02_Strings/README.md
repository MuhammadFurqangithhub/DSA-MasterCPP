# 📂 Strings - DSA-MasterCPP

Welcome to the **Strings** section of **DSA-MasterCPP**!  
This folder contains optimized and efficient C++ solutions for common string-based problems. These solutions will help you understand various string manipulation techniques, algorithms, and patterns that are essential for coding interviews, competitive programming, and university exams. 🚀

## 🔥 Problem Set

1. **Anagram Grouping**  
   Group words that are anagrams of each other into separate lists.

2. **First Non-Repeating Character**  
   Find the first non-repeating character in a string.

3. **Implement `atoi` (String to Integer)**  
   Implement the string-to-integer conversion function similar to `atoi`.

4. **Rabin-Karp String Search**  
   Perform efficient pattern matching in a string using the Rabin-Karp algorithm.

5. **Longest Substring with All Unique Characters**  
   Find the length of the longest substring with all unique characters.

6. **Count and Say**  
   Generate the n-th term of the "Count and Say" sequence.

7. **Shortest Superstring**  
   Find the shortest superstring that contains all the given words as substrings.

8. **Word Break**  
   Determine if a string can be segmented into valid words from a dictionary.

9. **Run-Length Encoding**  
   Implement run-length encoding for a given string.

10. **Z Algorithm**  
    Implement the Z algorithm to find occurrences of a pattern within a string.

## 📝 Key Concepts

- **String Manipulation**: Operations like reversing, substring extraction, pattern matching.
- **Hashing**: Used for anagram detection, pattern matching (Rabin-Karp).
- **Sliding Window**: Used in problems like longest unique substring.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Used in problems like Word Break and Count and Say.
