# 📁 01_Arrays - Mastering Arrays in C++

This folder contains optimized and tricky C++ programs focused on **array manipulation**, **pointer usage**, and **interview-level logic**. Each program is designed to strengthen your understanding of arrays in C++, with clean and efficient solutions.

---

## 📜 Programs List

### ✅ `01_reverse_array.cpp`
Reverses an array in-place using the **two-pointer** technique.  
💡 *One of the most common interview problems to test your grip on basic array operations.*

---

### ✅ `02_move_zeroes.cpp`
Moves all zeroes to the end of the array **without changing the relative order** of non-zero elements.  
✨ *Implemented using two raw pointers — avoids indexing completely, ideal for understanding low-level manipulation.*

## 🚀 Upcoming Programs (Planned)

- 🔢 Find second largest element
- 🚫 Remove duplicates from sorted array (in-place)
- 🔁 Left rotate array by D positions
- 🎨 Sort 0s, 1s, and 2s (Dutch National Flag Problem)
- 📈 Maximum subarray sum (Kadane’s Algorithm)
- 🔄 Check if array is sorted and rotated
- 🔀 Merge two sorted arrays in-place
- 🔍 Array intersection and union
- 🎯 Subarray with given sum
- 🗳️ Majority element using Boyer-Moore
- 📆 Longest consecutive subsequence
- ➕ Rearranging positive and negative numbers
- 🧠 Leaders in an array
