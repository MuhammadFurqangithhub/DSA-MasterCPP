# 📁 03_LinkedLists - Advanced Linked List Programs in C++

This folder contains 10 advanced C++ programs focused on **linked list algorithms**, **data structure manipulations**, and **interview-level logic**. Each program is optimized for clarity, performance, and demonstrates crucial linked list techniques.

## 📜 Programs List

### ✅ `01_clone_random_pointer.cpp`  
Clones a linked list where each node has both a **next** pointer and a **random** pointer.  
💡 *Tests complex pointer manipulations and deep copying.*

---

### ✅ `02_merge_sort_linkedlist.cpp`  
Performs **merge sort** on a singly linked list.  
🔄 *Demonstrates divide-and-conquer sorting with linked lists.*

---

### ✅ `03_flatten_multilevel_list.cpp`  
Flattens a multilevel linked list (where nodes can have child lists) into a single-level linked list.  
✨ *Handles recursion and pointer adjustments.*

---

### ✅ `04_merge_k_sorted_lists.cpp`  
Merges **k sorted linked lists** into one sorted list efficiently.  
🚀 *Uses priority queue (min-heap) for optimal merging.*

---

### ✅ `05_detect_and_remove_loop.cpp`  
Detects and removes a cycle/loop in a linked list using **Floyd’s cycle-finding algorithm**.  
🔄 *Essential for ensuring list integrity.*

---

### ✅ `06_flatten_multilevel_dll.cpp`  
Flattens a multilevel **doubly linked list** into a single-level doubly linked list.  
🔗 *In-place flattening while maintaining prev and next pointers.*

---

### ✅ `07_intersection_point.cpp`  
Finds the **intersection node** where two singly linked lists merge.  
🔍 *Uses length difference or two-pointer technique.*

---

### ✅ `08_reverse_nodes_in_k_group.cpp`  
Reverses nodes of the linked list **in groups of k**.  
♻️ *Complex pointer reversal with grouping constraints.*

---

### ✅ `09_lru_cache.cpp`  
Implements an **LRU (Least Recently Used) Cache** using a doubly linked list and hashing.  
⚡ *Supports O(1) get and put operations.*

---

### ✅ `10_bt_to_dll.cpp`  
Converts a **binary tree** to a doubly linked list using **inorder traversal**.  
🌳 *Tree-to-list transformation while preserving node order.*
